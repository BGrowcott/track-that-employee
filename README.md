- Upon Starting the application a user is presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.
    - Choosing to view all departments displays a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
    - Choosing to view all roles displays a formatted table showing job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
